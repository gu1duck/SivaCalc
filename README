This is a playground that brute-forces Siva Engine puzzles from Destiny. To use it, enter the values of the siva engine nodes into the input array. Each line of the arrayThis is a playground that brute-forces siva sngine puzzles from Destiny. To use it, enter the values of the siva engine nodes into the `input` array, the starting number into the `startingNumber` constant and the desired target number into the `endingNumber` constant Each line of the array represents a column, so the first line is the far-left column. I have not put in functionality to parse `+`, `-`, `*2` or `/2` nodes — just pre-calculate these before entering them (`-40 * 2` = `-80`, for example). The playground print all possible answers to the terminal; there will usually be quite a few. 

This is a really inefficient program—sorry.
